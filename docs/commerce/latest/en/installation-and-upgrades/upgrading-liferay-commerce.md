# Upgrading Liferay Commerce

To enhance the quality of your experience with Liferay Commerce, Liferay provides periodic product upgrades with bug fixes and new features. Users should consider regularly updating to the latest release.

## Upgrading to Commerce 4.0

Starting with Liferay Commerce 3.0, Commerce is now bundled with Liferay DXP. To upgrade to Commerce 4.0, you must first upgrade your base Liferay DXP installation to DXP 7.4 and perform a search re-index.

```{warning}
After upgrading to 7.4, do *not* deploy the Commerce `LPKG` again. The Commerce 4.0 modules are bundled with 7.4. Deploying the `LPKG` causes conflicts.
```

To learn more about the DXP upgrade process, see [Upgrade Basics](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/upgrade-basics.html). Once DXP is upgraded to 7.4, execute a re-index.

### Prerequisite for Upgrading to Liferay Commerce 4.0

The `CommerceCountry` table is deprecated in Liferay Commerce 4.0 and is being replaced by the `Country` table. While the `CommerceCountry` table only required the name of the country, the Country table requires the name and the Alpha-2 (a2) and Alpha-3 (a3) code for each country.

The `CommerceCountry` table may be populated if you are using the Minium Accelerator or if you are using your own values. If you are not using the Minium Accelerator, the table can be empty. As a prerequisite before upgrading to Liferay DXP 7.4, you must ensure that each country in the `CommerceCountry` table has its ISO code pre-populated. See [Country Codes (ISO)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code) for more information.

### Executing a Post-Upgrade Reindex

After upgrading to DXP 7.4, execute a full search re-index.

1. Open the _Global Menu_, and go to _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Search_.

   ![Go to Search in the Control Panel tab.](./upgrading-liferay-commerce/images/02.png)

1. Under the _Index Actions_ tab, click _Execute_ for _Reindex all search indexes_.

Once the reindex has finished, verify it was successful by going to _Commerce_ &rarr; _Products_ in the Global Menu and confirming that all products are displayed.

## Upgrading to Commerce 3.0 from 2.1 and Below

To upgrade to Commerce 3.0, you must first upgrade your base Liferay DXP installation to DXP 7.3 and then execute a search re-index.

```{warning}
After upgrading to 7.3, do *not* deploy the Commerce `LPKG` again. The Commerce 3.0 modules are bundled with 7.3. Deploying the `LPKG` causes conflicts.
```

### Executing a Post-Upgrade Reindex

After upgrading to DXP 7.3, execute a full search re-index.

1. Open the _Global Menu_ and go to _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Search_.

   ![Go to Search in the Control Panel tab.](./upgrading-liferay-commerce/images/02.png)

1. Under the _Index Actions_ tab, click on _Execute_ for _Reindex all search indexes_.

Once the reindex has finished, verify it was successful by going to _Commerce_ &rarr; _Products_ in the Global Menu and confirming that all products are displayed.

## Upgrading to Commerce 2.1.x

Liferay Commerce provides a seamless upgrade process to Commerce 2.1.x, whether from version 1.1.x or 2.0.x.

```{note}
Upgrading from 1.1.x to 2.1.x does **not** require an incremental upgrade to 2.0.x.
```

Before upgrading to Commerce 2.1.x, you must first be running the latest fix pack of Liferay DXP 7.2. For example, if upgrading to Liferay Commerce Enterprise 2.0.6 - upgrading Liferay DXP to Fix Pack 14 is required. To learn about upgrading to DXP 7.2, see [Upgrade Basics](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/upgrade-basics.html).

### Apply the Latest Fix Pack

> Subscription Required

Liferay provides the latest fix pack releases for download at the [Help Center](https://customer.liferay.com/downloads). Once downloaded, you can apply the fix pack using the [Liferay Patching Tool](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360018176551-Using-the-Patching-Tool). See [Installing Patches](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028810512-Installing-Patches) for more information.

If Liferay DXP was [installed manually](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360017896672-Installing-Liferay-DXP-Manually-) (for example, on WebLogic), see [Installing Patches on the Liferay DXP 7.1 WAR](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360018176651-Installing-patches-on-the-Liferay-DXP-7-1-WAR).

Then, follow these step to verify the fix pack was successfully installed:

1. Navigate to the `${liferay.home}/patching-tool` folder.

1. Verify that the fix pack has been applied by executing the following:
    * Linux/Unix: `./patching-tool.sh info`
    * Windows: `patching-tool info`

    ```
    Detailed patch list:
       [ -] dxp-12-7110 :: Currently not installed; Won't be installed: dxp-14 contains the fixes included in this one :: Built for LIFERAY
       [*I] dxp-14-7110 :: Installed; Will be installed. :: Built for LIFERAY
    ```

Fix Packs are cumulative in nature and include all previously release fix packs. After patching, remove Liferay DXP's cache of deployed code by deleting the contents of the `${liferay.home}/work` folder. See the next section on how to remove other stale data.
