# Pricing Permissions

With Liferay Commerce, you can use permissions to control access to Pricing applications and resources in the Commerce tab of the Global Menu (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)).

You can manage Pricing permissions for user roles under *Commerce* &rarr; *Pricing* in the Define Permissions tab. Assign permissions individually, or check *Action* to assign all permissions for an application or resource.

## Application Permissions

Application permissions grant abilities for an application itself, but do not include [related resource permissions](#resource-permissions).

Pricing includes the following applications:

**Price Lists**: This application is used to create and manage Price List entities that store Product price entries.

**Discounts**: This application is used to create and manage Discount entities that modify prices.

**Promotions**: This application is used to create and manage Promotions, which are entities that store Product price entries that can be applied to a Product in place of its other Price List entries.

**Product Groups**: This application is used to create and manage Product Group entities.

**Tax Categories**: This application is used to create and manage categories for applying tax rates to Channel Products and shipping costs. See [Creating Tax Categories](../../store-administration/configuring-taxes/creating-tax-categories.md) for more information.

All Pricing applications have the following permissions:

| Permission | Description |

## Resource Permissions

Resource permissions grant specific abilities related to application resources. Some of these permissions grant the ability to perform operations on database entities (i.e., model resources). Others grant the ability to perform resource-related operations in an application context (e.g., the ability to create a new resource entity).

Pricing applications reference the following resources:

**Commerce Price List** (listed under Price Lists and Product Groups): These permissions grant the ability to perform operations on Price List entities. Price List entities are used to store price entries for Product SKUs. This includes Base Price Lists and custom Price Lists, as well as Base Promotion Lists and custom Promotion Lists. Each list is linked to a single Catalog and has the following configuration options: currency, priority, schedule, eligibility, and price modifiers.
