# Using Price Tiers

With Liferay Commerce, you can use *Price Tiers* to offer price reductions based on the quantity of a product ordered. Prices set in this way take precedence for associated users if the specified minimum quantity is met.

Follow these steps to add tiered pricing to an existing Price List:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Applications Menu icon](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), click on the *Commerce* tab, and go to *Pricing* &rarr; *Price Lists*.

1. Click on the desired *Price List*, and go to the *Entries* tab.

1. Click on the desired price entry.

1. Use the radio button in the *Price Tiers* section to select either *Bulk Pricing* or *Tiered Pricing*.

   ```{note}
   While both price tier options are configured in the same way, they apply prices differently. *Bulk Pricing* applies the same tier price to all items in qualifying bulk orders, while *Tiered Pricing* applies different prices to order items according to defined pricing tiers.      
   ```

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)).

1. Enter a *Quantity* to determine the minimum quantity for receiving the bulk price.

1. Enter a *Tier Price* to determine the individual price of each product in the bulk order.

1. Determine whether the tier price overrides active discounts on the product. If enabled, you can define custom discount levels for buyers who have been offered the list price and purchased the minimum quantity.

   ```{note}
   You can set different discount levels that are applied on top of each other and modify the price. If there are two discounts on the same level (e.g., L1), the algorithm applies the better of the two. However, if there are two discounts on different levels (e.g., L1 and L2) the algorithm applies both.
   ```

1. Click on *Submit*, and then click on *Save* in the *Edit Price* window.

1. Enter the following fields (example values shown below):

        ![Add a tiered pricing entry](./using-price-tiers/images/01.png)

1. Click Save.

A pricing tier ($90) has been created for orders that reach the minimum quantity (20) for the product (_Premium Brake Fluid_) on the price list (_VIP Customers_). Repeat the steps to add successive price tiers to the same product and price list (for other minimum quantities), or to add a price tier to another product and price list.
