Commerce Catalogs provides four out-of-the-box Product types: Simple, Grouped, Virtual and Diagram.

**[Simple Product](./product-types/creating-a-simple-product.md)**: Any physical product for which inventory is tracked.

**[Grouped Product](./product-types/creating-a-grouped-product.md)**: Two or more Products from the Catalog that are packaged together and sold as a single item. Grouped Products are tracked in your inventory and can contain Simple Products, other Grouped Products, or Virtual Products.

**[Virtual Products](./product-types/creating-a-virtual-product.md)**: Any non-tangible Product, such as music files, electronic publications, services, and warranties.

**[Shop by Diagram](./product-types/shop-by-diagram.md)**: These are component parts belonging to a Bill of Materials (BOM) diagram that reference products in the store.
