# Setting Up Commerce Warehouses

Commerce Warehouses represent physical locations where Product inventory is stored. Each Warehouse can be linked to multiple Channels and must have a set geolocation to be activated. These geolocations are used by the Fedex shipping method when calculating shipping costs for customers.

When using an [accelerator](../../starting-a-store/accelerators.md) to create a Commerce Site, three sample Warehouses are created.

```{note}
When setting up commerce warehouses, users may need to first enable the applicable country and region location of the Warehouse (state or province). See [Adding Regions](../../store-administration/adding-regions.md) for more information.
```

## Adding a Warehouse

Follow these steps to add a new Warehouse:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), click on the *Commerce* tab, and go to *Warehouses*.

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add Button](../../images/icon-add.png)).

   ![Click the Add button to create a new Warehouse.](./setting-up-commerce-warehouses/images/01.png)

1. Enter a *Name* and *Description* (optional) for the new Warehouse.

1. Switch the toggle to *Active*. Activating a Warehouse requires a geolocation.

1. Select which *Channels* are associated with the Warehouse.

   Product inventory for a Channel is determined by its associated Warehouses.

1. Enter a Warehouse *Address*.

1. Enter the Warehouse's *Geolocation* (required for activation).

   Alternatively, you can use Bing Geocoder to automatically generate a Warehouse's geolocation. Using this feature requires the Warehouse has an address. See [below](#using-bing-geocoder-to-set-a-warehouses-geolocation) for more information.

1. Click *Save*.

Once the Warehouse is activated, you can [add Product inventory](./setting-inventory-by-warehouse.md) to it.

## Using Bing Geocoder to Set a Warehouse's Geolocation

Commerce provides integration with the Bing Maps API to automatically generate Warehouse geolocations. To use this feature, you must have a [Bing Maps account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/creating-a-bing-maps-account) and [Bing Maps Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key).

Then, follow these steps to configure the Bing Geocoder for your instance:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), and go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Shipping* &rarr; *Bing Geocoder*.

1. Enter your *API Key*.

   ![Enter your API Key](./setting-up-commerce-warehouses/images/02.png)

1. Click *Save*.

Once the Geocoder is configured, you can generate Warehouse geolocations for any Warehouse with a set address. Simply navigate to the Warehouses page, click on the *Actions* button (![Actions Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)) for the desired Warehouse, and select *Geolocate*. The Geocoder converts the address into latitude and longitude coordinates.
