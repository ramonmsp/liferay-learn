# Using the Price Range Facet Widget

Liferay Commerce includes the *Price Range Facet* widget for quickly filtering Product search results by price. To use this widget, ensure the Commerce Search Results widget is also deployed to the desired page.

```{note}
Starting with Liferay DXP 7.3 SP2, the Price Range Facet widget uses a Product's lowest price for filtering results.

For earlier Commerce versions, the widget uses a Product's base price and only works with Products that have a single SKU. Products with multiple SKUs are not displayed when the facet is active.
```
