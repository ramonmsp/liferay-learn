This automatically activates the widget. Once a Virtual Product is purchased, the asset appears here, based on its *Activation Status*:

| Configuration | Effect on Visibility |
| --- | --- |
| Activation Status | Determines the order stage at which the asset becomes available to download (i.e., Completed, Pending, or Processing). |
| Duration | The number of days for which the asset is available to download. |
| Max Number of Downloads | The number of times the asset can be downloaded for a single purchase. |

The table above details the configuration options available to a Virtual Product. These options control the visibility of the product on the Product Downloads widget.
