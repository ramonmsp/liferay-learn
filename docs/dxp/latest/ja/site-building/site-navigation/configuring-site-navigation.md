<!--
This content should probably be moved out to being part of Managing / Configuring Site Navigation / Changing Site Navigation Order and Hierarchy or something like that.

Creating a page by default also adds it to any Navigation Menus that are configured to have new pages added to them. You can drag and drop pages to reorder their position in the page hierarchy (and subsequently the default navigation that users see). Drag a page on top of an existing page to create a child page.

If you don't want a new page added to a specific Navigation Menu that is listed during page creation, uncheck the box for that menu. Pages are as flexible as pages you'd create manually without Liferay Portal. Using an intuitive interface, you can define your Site any way you want. You can create and remove pages, export and import them, set their layouts, define how they are indexed by search engines, and more. -->
