# Creating a Workflow Powered Application

> **Subscribers**

Workflow Powered Applications require data from multiple stakeholders. These process-driven applications can go through multiple stages before the object's data is fully fleshed out. These apps can even send the processing back to previous stages/stakeholders.

To create an example application, read

* [Creating the Role Change Request Object](./creating-the-role-change-request-object.md)
* [Creating the Role Change Request App](./creating-the-role-change-request-app.md)

Workflow Powered Apps are designed by thinking about the steps the object's forms must pass through before being considered complete.

![The Role Change Request object goes through several steps before it's completely filled out.](./creating-a-workflow-powered-application/images/02.png)

Each step has configuration options depending on its stage in the workflow:

| Step | Configuration Options | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| Start (Initial Step) | Step Name <br /> Main Data Object <br /> Form View <br /> Table View <br /> Action | At a minimum, choose an object, form view, and table view so that the data object can begin getting filled out. There's no assignee, because anyone who can add a record begins the processing. The action can be renamed but always proceeds to the next step. |
| 1 (Step 1) | Step Name <br /> Assignee <br /> Form View <br /> Action | Name the step and assign it to a [Role](../../users-and-permissions/roles-and-permissions/understanding-roles-and-permissions.md). Then choose or create a form view (set it to read only or editable) and name the action that transitions to the next step. |
| Additional Numbered Steps (e.g., Step 2, 3, 4, etc.) | Same as for step 1, plus the _Add New Action_ option | Additional steps can do everything that Step 1 can do, plus create a new action that transitions back to the previous workflow step, if necessary. |
| End (Final Step) | Step Name | Name the last step in the workflow process |

## App Versions

Workflow Powered Apps are versioned, because [workflow processes are versioned](../../process-automation/workflow/designing-and-managing-workflows/managing-workflows.md#viewing-and-restoring-workflow-revisions). A new version of the app is created when you

- Add, edit, or remove steps or transitions in the workflow process (actions that generate a new version of the workflow process).
- Add, update, or remove a form view in one of the workflow steps.
- Add, update, or remove the assignees of a workflow step.

A new version of the Workflow Powered App only applies to new submissions. The app's manager can check the version for each submission from its details view---view the record's details by clicking on it in a table view.
