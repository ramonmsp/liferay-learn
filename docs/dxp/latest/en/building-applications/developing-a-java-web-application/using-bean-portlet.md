Portlet 3.0, the [JSR 362](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=362) standard, features a style of portlet development called Bean Portlets that use Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI). Bean Portlets fully leverage [all the Portlet 3.0 features](https://portals.apache.org/pluto/v301/v3Features.html) in compliant portals, and are fully supported in Liferay DXP. Here are the Bean Portlet topics:

* [Bean Portlet \(Help Center\)](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028708752-Bean-Portlet) introduces key Bean Portlet features.
* [Creating a Bean Portlet \(Help Center\)](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028708772-Creating-a-Bean-Portlet) demonstrates generating a Bean Portlet project and developing a Bean Portlet.
* [Reference](./using-bean-portlet/reference.md) facilitates feature detail lookup.
