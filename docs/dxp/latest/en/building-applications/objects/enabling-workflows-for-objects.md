# Enabling Workflow for Objects

Every published Object is integrated automatically with the Workflow framework, so you can direct Object entry creation through a defined review and approval process. How you enable a Workflow for an Object depends on the Object's scope: [Company](#company-scoped-objects) or [Site](#site-scoped-objects).

See [Workflow](../../process-automation/workflow.html) documentation to learn more about general workflow features.
