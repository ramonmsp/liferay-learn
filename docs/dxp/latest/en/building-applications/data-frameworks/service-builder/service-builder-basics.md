Using Service Builder helps you learn it. You'll use it to learn the basics:

1. [Generating Model, Persistence, and Service Code](./service-builder-basics/generating-model-persistence-and-service-code.md): You'll define a basic model, generate code from it, and deploy the code to DXP. You'll verify the generated database tables and test the new service on DXP.

1. [Understanding and Extending Generated Classes](./service-builder-basics/understanding-service-builder-generated-classes.md): Describes the generated classes and extension implementation classes. You'll extend a base implementation, add a service operation to the API, and publish it DXP.

1. [Invoking a Service Locally](./service-builder-basics/invoking-a-service-locally.md): Demonstrates using the service in a portlet application.

Start with [Generating Model, Persistence, and Service Code](./service-builder-basics/generating-model-persistence-and-service-code.md).
