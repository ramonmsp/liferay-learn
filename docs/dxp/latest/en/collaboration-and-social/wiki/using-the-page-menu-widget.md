# Using the Page Menu Widget

The *Page Menu* widget presents links that can include links to other [Wiki Pages](./getting-started-with-wikis.md),other DXP site pages, Documents and Media assets, external websites, and more. Once you've added the widget to a Page, you need to configure which Wiki Page it uses and its sources for links. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the widgetâ€™s *Options* icon (![Actions Button](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Configuration*.
