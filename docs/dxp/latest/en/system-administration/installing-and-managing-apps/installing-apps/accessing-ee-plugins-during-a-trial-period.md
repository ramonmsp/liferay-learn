# Accessing EE Plugins During a Trial Period

If you are evaluating DXP during a trial period, you can access certain EE plugins.

Here are the steps:

1. In the Control Panel, navigate to _Apps_ &rarr; _Store_.

1. Sign in with your liferay.com account.

    ```{important}
    Purchasing apps requires that you have a [liferay.com](https://www.liferay.com) account and agree to the Marketplace Terms of Use.
    ```

1. Once signed into the Store, click on the _Purchased_ link, and then click on the _EE_ tab.

A list of EE plugins appears. During your trial period, you can access and use these DXP EE plugins.

```{note}
During your trial period, plugin management for EE plugins is only available in the *Control Panel*; the *Purchased* -> *EE* tab on the Marketplace website becomes available only after you've purchased an enterprise subscription.
```

```{important}
EE plugin source code is only available to you after you get an official enterprise subscription.
```
