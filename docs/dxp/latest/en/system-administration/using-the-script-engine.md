DXP provides a robust script engine for executing [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) scripts to maintain your Liferay DXP instance. You can execute scripts to perform maintenance tasks involving data cleanup, user maintenance operations, bulk Liferay API invocations, or even system level operations.

![The Script Console executes Groovy scripts and provides context variables, such as the current actionRequest. The Script Console was designed for invoking Liferay Services.](./using-the-script-engine/images/01.png)

## Navigating to the Script Engine

The Script Console is available in the Control Panel. To use the Script Engine, follow these steps:

1. Log in as an Admin user
1. Open the [Product Menu](../../getting-started/navigating-dxp.md) and navigate to the Control Panel and select *Configuration* &rarr; *Server Administration* &rarr; *Script*.

    ![The Script Console is a tab within the System Administration menu.](./using-the-script-engine/images/02.png)
