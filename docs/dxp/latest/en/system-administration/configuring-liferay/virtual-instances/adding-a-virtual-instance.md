# Adding a Virtual Instance

Before you do anything in Liferay DXP to add a Virtual Instance, you must configure its domain name in your network to point to your installed Liferay DXP system.

Once the domain name is ready, create the Virtual Instance:

1. Go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Virtual Instances*. 

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)). This opens the *New Instance* form. 

1. Complete the New Instance form as follows:

![Fill out the Add Virtual Instance form.](./adding-a-virtual-instance/images/02.png)

**Web ID:** Specify the instance ID. Using the domain name is a common convention.

**Virtual Host:** Set the domain name you configured in your network. When people use the domain name, they are directed automatically to this instance. 

**Mail Domain:** Enter the mail host's domain name for the Virtual Instance. Email notifications are sent from the instance using this domain. 

**Max Users:** Set the maximum number of user accounts the Virtual Instance supports. Enter `0` to support unlimited users. 

**Active:** Set the Virtual Instance to active or inactive. Inactive Virtual Instances aren't accessible to anyone, even the administrator. 

Click *Save* when you're done filling out the form. 

Now you can navigate to the instance using its domain name. You're brought to what looks like a clean install of Liferay DXP. This is your new Virtual Instance! You can configure it any way you like. 

What follows is a description of all Virtual Instance options.
