# System Settings

You can make [System-scoped](./understanding-configuration-scope.md) configurations from Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr; System Settings.

The System Settings application shows configuration sections underneath four categories: Platform, Security, Content and Data, and Other. Each section contains one or more configuration entries.

Navigate to the configuration you need by finding a section (e.g., Content and Data) of interest, then browse its categories (e.g., Workflow).

![System Settings entries are organized by section (e.g., Content and Data) and category (e.g., Assets).](./system-settings/images/02.png)

If you can't locate a System Settings entry by browsing, search for it using the search bar.

```{note}
Some system-scoped configurations can be made in properties files and in the Server Administration application in the Control Panel.
```

Liferay DXP contains many applications. The applications and their services may be configurable at several [scopes](./understanding-configuration-scope.md), as defined by the application's developers. Configuration made in System Settings is system scoped or sets system-wide default configurations that can be overridden at another scope.

If you don't know what a configuration option does, check the documentation for that feature.

## Editing System Configurations

Once you find the configuration to modify,

1. Open the configuration form for the entry.

1. Make any changes, then click *Save*. Your configuration changes are saved and applied throughout the system.

   ```{important}
   Content generated using templates (e.g., FreeMarker templates and Application Display Templates) is cached. Cached content might not reflect configuration changes until the cache is invalidated (cleared). The Server Administration -> Resources tab provides cache clearing options.
   ```

## Resetting a System Settings Entry

System settings can be reset to their default value by clicking the actions button (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)), then clicking *Reset Default Values*.

## Exporting and Deploying Configurations

System Settings are portable. To apply the same configurations in another installation, you can export configurations; either a single configuration entry or all the entries that you changed. The exported files are deployable to any Liferay DXP installation of the same version.

To export a single entry's configurations, click the actions button (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)), then click *Export*. A `.config` file containing your configuration downloads to your system.

To export all the configuration changes you've made in System Settings, click the System Settings options button (![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)), then click *Export All Settings*. The `.config` files for all the entries you edited then download in a ZIP file.

To make these configurations active in the destination system, unzip and place the `.config` files in the [`[Liferay_Home]/osgi/configs` folder](../../installation-and-upgrades/reference/liferay-home.md).
