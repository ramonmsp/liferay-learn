# Elasticsearch Indexes Reference

The default Liferay DXP 7.3 indexes in your installation approximate the list below (subject to change). The default global *Index Name Prefix* is `liferay-`: it can be changed in the Elasticsearch 7 connector configuration. `20101` is the generated `companyId` of a given Company in your database. It is displayed as Instance ID in the UI and represents a [Virtual Instance](../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/virtual-instances/understanding-virtual-instances.md).

Liferay 7.2 index names are more complex, as patches have introduced changes to the index naming pattern. See [Multi-Tenant Index Names](../getting-started/whats-new-in-search-for-73.md#multi-tenant-index-names) for more information.
```

```{note}
Liferay DXP provides APIs for creating and using (writing to and reading from) custom Elasticsearch indexes that remain completely under your control. See the [Developer Guide](../developer-guide.html) for information on using these APIs.

If you have a [Liferay Commerce](https://www.liferay.com/products/commerce) subscription and it is activated in your installation, you also have these indexes:

| Index ID                                                     | Index Type    | Index Purpose |
