A Liferay Enterprise Search (LES) subscription provides access to additional search features beyond what's available out of the box with your Liferay DXP subscription. To see a detailed description of the services and features included with LES on your version of Liferay DXP, refer to the official description of LES in the [Liferay DXP Components resource](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014400932). While LES is installed out of the box, a license is required to use its features. The activation article has more details:

- [Activating Liferay Enterprise Search](liferay-enterprise-search/activating-liferay-enterprise-search.md)

```{note}
LES customers receive a [platinum Elasticsearch license](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) from Liferay. There can be a delay between your subscription and receipt of the license, but you can enable a [30-day trial](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/start-trial.html) to work with in the meantime.  
```

Detailed installation and usage instructions are available in the article for each LES feature, including

- [Cross Cluster Replication](liferay-enterprise-search/cross-cluster-replication.md)
- [Learning to Rank](liferay-enterprise-search/learning-to-rank.md)
- [Monitoring Elasticsearch](liferay-enterprise-search/monitoring-elasticsearch.md)
- [Securing Elasticsearch](installing-and-upgrading-a-search-engine/elasticsearch/securing-elasticsearch.md) [Free without LES for Liferay CE and DXP with Elasticsearch 7] 

```{important}
Always check the [LES compatibility matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651#Liferay-Enterprise-Search) for compatibility information.
