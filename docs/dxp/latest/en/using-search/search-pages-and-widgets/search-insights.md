# Search Insights

> **This feature is intended for testing and development only** \
> **Works with Elasticsearch only**

The Search Insights Widget, when added to a Search Page, is for inspecting two things: 

- The query string that's constructed by the back-end search code when the User enters a keyword

- The response string returned from the search engine

```{note}
The JSON returned as a request string is pruned from several Elasticsearch query defaults for clarity. To see the full request JSON that Elasticsearch processed, adjust the [Elasticsearch server's logging](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/logging.html)_.
```

With the _Enable Score Explanation_ option (enabled by default), the Insights widget also prints a relevance score explanation for each returned result.

When Elasticsearch processes a search query, it returns results. The concept of _Relevance_ determines how well results match the query. The Score explanation for returned search documents helps clarify seemingly odd results, letting you adjust the relevancy scoring process by _boosting_ results---making matches in certain fields count for more.

## Inspecting The Search Query String

To see the Search Insights widget in action, navigate to a Search Page in your test server and add it from the Add menu (![Add](../../images/icon-add-widget.png)).

Once you search for keywords that return Search Results, the Search Insights portlet displays the returned query string in all its glory.

## Explaining Search Results

To enable or disable the Explain option,

1. Open the Search Insight widget's Configuration screen.

1. There's just one boolean field enabled by default: Enable Score Explanation. De-select it to disable the explanation of each result's relevance score.

Under the hood, the Explain option in the Search Insights widget exposes an Elasticsearch API: [Explain](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/search-explain.html). See the Elasticsearch documentation for more details.

Here's an abbreviated portion of the scoring explanation for the Search Document of the Test Test User when the searched keyword was _test_:

```json
_explanation":{  
   "value":9.461341,
   "description":"sum of:",
   "details":[  
      {  
         "value":9.461341,
         "description":"sum of:",
         "details":[  
            {  
               "value":1.0,
               "description":"emailAddress:*test*",
               "details":[  

               ]
            },
            {  
               "value":5.0,
               "description":"userName:*test*^5.0",
               "details":[  

               ]
            },
            {  
               "value":0.72928625,
               "description":"sum of:",
               "details":[  
                  ... 

            { 
               "value":1.0027686,
               "description":"sum of:",
               "details":[  
                  ...
                  {  
            {  
               "value":0.72928625,
               "description":"sum of:",
               "details":[  
                  ...
            {  
               "value":1.0,
               "description":"screenName:*test*",
               "details":[  

               ]
            }
         ]
      },
      ...
   ]
}}]}
```

Now you can see the entire query string, the response string, and how each returned Search Document was scored.
