# Publishing Documents

Liferay makes it easy to publish and showcase documents and other types of media files. As you begin [uploading media files](../uploading-and-managing/uploading-files.md), you probably want to start sharing them on your site.

The available widgets can highlight your documents and media files: *Media Gallery*, *Documents and Media*, and *Asset Publisher*. You can choose an appropriate widget based on your use case. 

You can embed and display Documents and Media files on other assets such as Web Content, Blogs, or Wiki pages.

## Using the Media Gallery Widget

This widget publishes your media in a simple gallery-like style. It shows a large thumbnail of each file, offers file downloads, and has slideshow capabilities. A common way to use the Media Gallery is to have a separate page for displaying media and add a Media Gallery widget to it. The widget displays only audio or video files. 

To use the Media Gallery widget,

1. From the Content Management category of widgets, add the Media Gallery widget to a page. 

    ![Locate the Media Gallery widget listed under the Content Management section of widgets.](publishing-documents-on-a-dxp-site/images/01.png)

1. Once the widget appears, any media files previously uploaded should already be visible. If you wish to [add additional media files](../uploading-and-managing/uploading-files.md), they can be uploaded from Documents and Media.

The Media Gallery widget has several options you can configure by clicking *Options* (![Options icon](../../../images/icon-options.png)) &rarr; _Configuration_: 

![The configuration window has four different tabs.](publishing-documents-on-a-dxp-site/images/02.png)

**Display Settings:** Show each file's actions, filter the media types to display, and choose a display template for your media.

**Folders Listing:** Select a Document Library folder to serve as the root folder from which to display files. This folder becomes the highest-level folder the widget can access. 

In the widget, clicking on any media file automatically starts a slideshow of all the files.

On each file is an *Options* (![Options icon](../../../images/icon-options.png)) icon:

## Using the Documents and Media Widget 

This widget provides a way to publish all types of files. Unlike the Media Gallery widget, you can publish documents and other types of media.

1. From the Content Management section, add the *Documents and Media* widget to a page.

**Entries listing for table display style:** Set what type of file information to display when the user selects Table view.

**Ratings:** Enable or disable the [ratings system](../../../collaboration-and-social/social-tools/user-guide/using-the-ratings-system.md).

The toolbar at the top of Documents and Media provides these functions:

**Reverse:** The *Reverse* icon (![Reverse icon](../../../images/icon-sort.png)) reverses the direction of the sorting. 

**Search:** Search through your media files by keyword.

**Information:** The *Information* icon (![Click on the information icon to display file info.](../../../images/icon-information.png)) provides details about the media files within the folder.

**Display Style:** The *Display Style* icon (![Click on the display style icon to choose your display option.](../../../images/icon-view-type-cards.png)) switches between three display types: Cards, List and Table view.

## Using the Asset Publisher Widget

The [Asset Publisher](../../../site-building/displaying-content/using-the-asset-publisher-widget/displaying-assets-using-the-asset-publisher-widget.md) widget can publish different assets and collections based on criteria. You can use it to display content from your Documents and Media library.
