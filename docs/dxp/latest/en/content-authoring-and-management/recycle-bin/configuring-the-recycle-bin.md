# Configuring the Recycle Bin

The Recycle Bin supports instance-wide scope or Site-specific scope. By default, the Recycle Bin is enabled instance-wide.

```{tip}
You can disable the Recycle Bin for a specific Site. If you disable the Recycle Bin while it is still holding recycled items, the recycled items remain stored and reappear in the Recycle Bin if it is re-enabled.
```

To configure the Recycle Bin,

1. Open the _Product Menu_ (![Product Menu](../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) then click the _compass_ icon (![Compass](../../images/icon-compass.png)) on the Site Administration menu.
1. Select the Site.
