# Selecting Assets in the Asset Publisher Widget

You can configure the Asset Publisher Widget to select Assets dynamically based on specific criteria, or manually, specifying exactly what assets to display. You can also display Assets from [Collections](../../../content-authoring-and-management/collections-and-collection-pages/about-collections-and-collection-pages.md).

```{note}
On Liferay 7.2 and below, Collections are referred to as [Content Sets](../../../content-authoring-and-management/collections-and-collection-pages/about-collections-and-collection-pages.md#liferay-dxp-7-2).
```

To select Assets to publish in the *Asset Publisher* widget,

1. Click the *Actions* menu (![Click on the Options button at the top-right corner of the widget for configuration.](../../../images/icon-options.png)) at the top-right corner of the Asset Publisher Widget.

    ![Click the Actions menu to access the Asset Publisher Configuration options.](./selecting-assets-in-the-asset-publisher-widget/images/01.png)

1. Select *Configuration* to display the Configuration dialog.

    Under Asset Selection, select how you want to filter your Assets. For a description of these options, see [Asset Selection Options](#asset-selection-options).

1. Optionally, click *Create a collection from this configuration* to save the configuration as a new [Collection](../../../content-authoring-and-management/collections-and-collection-pages/about-collections-and-collection-pages.md). This option is available for the [Dynamic](#dynamic) and [Manual](#manual) Asset selection options.

1. Once you've selected your Assets and configured the widget, click *Save*.
