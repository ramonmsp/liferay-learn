Some fields have an appended language flag button. These fields can be translated into other languages.

![Localizable fields are marked with a language flag.](./site-localization/images/04.png)

1. Click the language flag beside the field.

   ![Click the language flag next to the localizable field to enter a new value.](./site-localization/images/05.png)

1. Enter the new value in the selected language. The default value is displayed beneath the field for reference.

   ![Enter the new value for the selected language.](./site-localization/images/06.png)

Liferay automatically saves the translation for each language and displays the translated value when that language is selected for the instance. If a translation for the field is not provided, the default instance language's value for that field is displayed.
