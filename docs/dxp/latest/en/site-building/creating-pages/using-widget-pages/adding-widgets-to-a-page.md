# Adding Widgets to a Page

Widgets are applications. They can be simple, and only used to [display content](../../displaying_content.md), or they can be full-featured collaboration applications, like the [Message Boards widget](../../../collaboration-and-social/message-boards/user-guide/getting-started-with-message-boards.md).

Follow these steps to add a widget to a Widget Page:

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) in the Control Menu.

   ![The Widgets panel contains several default widgets that you can use to add functionality to the page.](./adding-widgets-to-a-page/images/01.png)

1. Open the *Widgets* panel and search or browse through the categories of available widgets to find the one you want.

1. Drag the widget to the column and row of the page layout where you want to place it.

```{tip}
In DXP 7.3+, you can click the eye icon at the top of any Widget Page to toggle the widget controls for all widgets. When disabled, the widget controls do not pop up when you hover your cursor over them.
```

```{note}
Widgets are rendered according to [render-weight](https://docs.liferay.com/dxp/portal/7.3-latest/definitions/liferay-portlet-app_7_3_0.dtd.html#render-weight) on Widget Pages.
```
