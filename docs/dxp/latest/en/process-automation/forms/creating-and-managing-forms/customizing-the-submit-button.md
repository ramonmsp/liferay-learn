# Customizing the Submit Button

When a User is finished entering data into a form, they must submit the form. By default a button that says _Submit_ is displayed for this purpose.

Sometimes _Submit_ isn't the clearest word for the action the User is taking when submitting the form. For example, you might want to use _Register Now_:

1. [Create a form](./creating-forms.md) with a text field called _Email Address_. Give it a name and publish it.

1. Go to the form and see its Submit button:

   ![A User submits their form with the Submit button.](./customizing-the-submit-button/images/02.png)

1. Now change the button label. Go back to the form builder view and click the ![Settings](../../../images/icon-settings.png) icon in the upper right.

1. In the Personalization tab, enter _Register Now_ in the Submit Button Label field.

1. Save the form, then go back to the form view and see that the button has your new label:

## Localizing the Button Label

Forms are [translatable](./translating-forms.md). If you have a translated form and you're customizing the form label for the default language, you should translate the label, too.

1. [Create a form](./creating-forms.md).
1. [Translate the form](./translating-forms.md).
1. In the default language, customize the button label from the ![Settings](../../../images/icon-settings.png) menu.
1. Switch to the translated form and repeat the procedure for the translation. You'll see the flag for the locale you're translating into next to the Submit Button Label field.

When finished, your form has a consistent lexicon across languages.
