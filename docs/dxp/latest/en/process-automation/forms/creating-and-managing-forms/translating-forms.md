## Viewing Translated Forms

Authenticated users that have configured a matching default language for the site now see the translated form by default.

If accessed in the [Form widget on a Liferay DXP page](../sharing-forms-and-managing-submissions/sharing-forms.md), the Form is displayed in the User’s language automatically. If there’s no translation available in a user's selected language, the default language of the Form is displayed.

## Viewing Translated Form Records

Starting in Liferay 7.4, The language of each form record is recorded in two locations for administrators: [exported form data](exporting-and-importing-forms.md) and from within the View Entries screen for a form.

To view the entries and their languages in the Liferay Forms application,

1. Open the Site Administration menu and go to Content & Data &rarr; Forms.
1. Open the Actions (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) menu for a form and click _View Entries_.

   ![Administrators can easily see the form record language.](./translating-forms/images/05.png)
