# Forms Configuration Reference

Here's an overview of all the Forms configurations so you can quickly find a configuration you need.

## Forms Options

You can export and import forms between Sites. To access the _Export / Import_ menu, navigate to _Site Administration_ &rarr; _Content and Data_  &rarr; _Forms_. Click the ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png) icon in the upper right then _Export / Import_.

See [Exporting and Importing Forms](./exporting-and-importing-forms.md) and [Importing and Exporting Pages and Content](../../../site-building/building-sites/importing-exporting-pages-and-content.md) to learn more.

## Form Settings

Each form has its own Settings menu.

To access the Settings menu, choose the desired form (for example, _Guest Survey Feedback_). Click the ![Settings](../../../images/icon-settings.png) icon in the upper right.

## Instance Settings

The Forms configuration entry in Instance Settings is identical to the Forms entry in System Settings (below); the instance settings override the system settings, which will set the default values across the system. See [Understanding Configuration Scope](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/understanding-configuration-scope.md) for more information.

For a description of each configuration property, see [System Settings](#system-settings).

## System Settings

There is currently only one system level Forms configuration entry. To configure the properties in the Liferay UI,

1. Go to the _Global Menu_ (![global icon](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) &rarr; _Control Panel_.
1. Click _System Settings_.
1. Click _Forms_ under the _Content and Data_ section.

![Configure Forms in the System Settings menu.](./forms-configuration-reference/images/07.png)

Alternatively, configure the backing `DDMFormWebConfiguration` service with a `.config` file named

```
com.liferay.dynamic.data.mapping.form.web.internal.configuration.DDMFormWebConfiguration.config
```

Place the file in `Liferay Home/osgi/configs`. See [Using Configuration Files](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/configuration-files-and-factories/using-configuration-files.md) for more information.
