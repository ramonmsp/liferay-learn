# Activating Workflow

You can activate a workflow process for an asset type either across the DXP instance or only on a specific site. When a workflow process is activated across the instance for a particular asset type such as _Wiki Pages_, all _Wiki Page_ submitted for publication must go through the review process regardless of which Site the _Wiki Page_ is created on.

Alternately, you can choose to enable or disable workflow on individual sites. By default, workflow is disabled on a site.

## Activating Workflow Across a DXP Instance

1. Open the _Product Menu_ (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and click _Control Panel_.
1. Click _Workflow_ then _Process Builder_.
1. Click the _Configurations_ tab.

    ![The Instance Wide Settings are found in the Configurations tab](./activating-workflow/images/02.png)

1. Click _Edit_ next to the Asset Type which will go through the workflow process (for example, _Knowledge Base Article_).

    ![Activating Workflow Across the Instance for Knowledge Base articles](./activating-workflow/images/03.png)

1. Select the workflow desired for this asset type (_Single Approver_ is available out of the box).
1. Click _Save_.
1. Repeat for all the other asset types which require workflow.

## Activating Workflow on a Site

When a workflow process is enabled on a site, other sites on the same instances remain disabled. To enable a workflow process for each asset type per site:

1. Open the _Product Menu_ (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) then click the compass icon (![Compass](../../../images/icon-compass.png)) on the _Site Administration_ menu.
1. Select the site where the form will be created (for example, _Community Site_).
1. In the _Site Administration_ menu, click _Configuration_ &rarr; _Workflow_.
1. Click _Edit_ next to the Asset Type which will go through the workflow process.
1. Select the workflow desired for this asset type.

1. Click _Save_.
1. Repeat for all the other asset types which require workflow.

Once enabled, the selected asset types always require a review process before publication on this site. If you have previously activated workflow for a particular asset type, those settings are reflected here.

```{tip}
You can always disable workflow for an asset type on a site even if it was enabled instance wide.
```

## Page Variations

In a [staged environment](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029041851-Staging-Content), you can activate workflow for _Page Variations_.

As a prerequisite, [Staging](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360029041811-Enabling-Staging) **and** [Page Versioning](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360028721532-Enabling-Page-Versioning-and-Staged-Content) have been enabled.

When a Page Variation or Site Page Variation is created, its creator must click _Submit for Publication_ at the top of the page, and the variation must be approved in the workflow before it can be published to the live Site.

To enable a workflow for Page Variations:

1. Navigate to the _Site Administration_ menu for your site.
1. Verify that the Staging has been enabled for this site.

    ![Verify that the site is now staged.](./activating-workflow/images/11.png)

1. Click _Configuration_ &rarr; _Workflow_.
1. Select the workflow desired for _Page Revision_.

    ![Verify that the site is now staged.](./activating-workflow/images/12.png)
