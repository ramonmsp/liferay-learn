Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides better security by requiring users to prove their identity in multiple ways, or _factors_. The basic user name/password combination is augmented with one or more further, configurable factors. These include the default One Time Password (OTP) and configurable IP address, time-based OTP, [FIDO2-compliant](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2) devices, and because the system is extensible, any factor you wish to write.
