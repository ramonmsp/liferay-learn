Custom code updates to the latest Liferay DXP/Portal 7.x versions are done the same way as updates to 7.2. The [Liferay Upgrade Planner](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147451-Liferay-Upgrade-Planner) is still the recommended way to upgrade custom development. It identifies your code that's affected by breaking changes (from [7.2](../../liferay-internals/reference/7-2-breaking-changes.md), [7.3](../../liferay-internals/reference/7-3-breaking-changes.md), and [7.4](../../liferay-internals/reference/7-4-breaking-changes.md)) and offers to automatically adapt your code to many of the changes.

```{note}
If you're upgrading a language key override to 7.4+, follow the [language key override upgrade instructions](./upgrading-custom-development/upgrading-language-key-overrides.md) first.
```
