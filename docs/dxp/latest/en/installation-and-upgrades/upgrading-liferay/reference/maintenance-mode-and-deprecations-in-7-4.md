# Maintenance Mode and Deprecations in 7.4

With each new Liferay DXP and Liferay Portal release, a feature may not warrant continued enhancements or may become obsolete. Stopping enhancements for a feature puts it in *Maintenance Mode*.

**Maintenance Mode:** The feature is supported but no longer being enhanced.

Obsolete features are eventually removed or replaced with newer, better features. Before dropping support for an obsolete feature, Liferay marks it *Deprecated*.

**Deprecated:** The feature will be unsupported as early as the next minor version release. For example, support for a feature deprecated in 7.4 can be dropped as early as 7.5.

```{important}
Plan to stop using deprecated features because their support may cease as early as the next minor release.
```

```{important}
Please see [Maintenance Mode and Deprecation Policies](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015767952-Maintenance-Mode-and-Deprecation) for details.
```

## Deprecated Feature Availability

Deprecated features have different availability:

**Bundled:** The feature is included in the Liferay software.

**Marketplace:** The feature is included in a Marketplace app final version.

**Final:** The final version of the Marketplace app is released for this Liferay version.

**Archived:** The feature is unavailable, but its code is available in a sources artifact on Liferay's repository at <https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/index.html#welcome>.

**Removed:** The feature and its code are unavailable.
