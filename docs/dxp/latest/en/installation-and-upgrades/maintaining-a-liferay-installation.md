As Liferay fixes bugs and adds features, you'll want to keep up with them. Liferay DXP 7.4+ has *rolling releases*. This means that fixes and non-obtrusive features are added to the DXP source code continuously and then made available to Enterprise Subscribers in Update Releases (Updates). Subscribers can request [Hot Fixes](./maintaining-a-liferay-installation/applying-a-hotfix.md) to mission critical issues confirmed in DXP.

```{important}
Liferay DXP 7.3 and earlier use a patching model---it's different from the rolling release model described above. If you're on 7.3 and earlier, please see [Patching Liferay](./maintaining-a-liferay-installation/patching-dxp-7-3-and-earlier.md).
```

An essential part of maintaining your installation is backing it up. Please see [Backing Up](./maintaining-a-liferay-installation/backing-up.md) for details on the system components to save regularly.

Then you can [apply the latest DXP Updates](./maintaining-a-liferay-installation/updating-liferay.md) as they roll in!
