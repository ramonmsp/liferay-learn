# Deploying to the Liferay Service

As with other services, deploying custom additions involves adding your configurations or files to the appropriate locations in your Git repository. However, deploying the Liferay service slightly differs from deploying other services.

The Liferay service makes use of a Liferay workspace <!-- Add link when available-->to give you more options to add [deployable files](#deploying-themes-portlets-and-osgi-modules), [source code](#building-and-deploying-source-code), and more. These are easily included with a [CI build](../build-and-deploy/overview-of-the-dxp-cloud-deployment-workflow.md), but if you are using the [CLI tool](../reference/command-line-tool.md), then some [extra steps](#cli-tool-deployment) are necessary specifically for the Liferay service.

## Defining the Liferay DXP Docker Image

The Liferay service image (defined in the `LCP.json` file, like other services) is not the same as the Liferay DXP Docker image. The Liferay DXP Docker image determines the exact version (including the fix pack) of Liferay that runs in your Liferay service. This is defined in your repository's `liferay/gradle.properties` file, with the `liferay.workspace.docker.image.liferay` property. 

Check the [Liferay DXP Docker tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/dxp/tags) to find the right image for your version of DXP.

```{important}
The major version number of DXP defined in the `image` property of the Liferay service's `LCP.json` file **must match** the major version in the `liferay.workspace.docker.image.liferay` property in `liferay/gradle.properties`. The Liferay service may fail to start up after deployment if the two are different.
```

## CLI Tool Deployment

Deploying with the [CLI tool](../reference/command-line-tool.md) requires extra steps to deploy with your customizations and configurations. These must be included in a special `Dockerfile` image that is generated before you deploy.

[Deployable files](#deploying-themes-portlets-and-osgi-modules), [built source code](#building-and-deploying-source-code), [hotfixes](#deploying-hotfixes), and [licenses](#deploying-licenses) require extra steps to include with your deployment if you are using the CLI tool. These extra steps are not necessary if you are using the [CI service](../platform-services/continuous-integration.md) to generate a build from your repository.

If you deploy the Liferay service with the CLI normally (when deploying all services at once, or from the `liferay/` directory), then a **default version** of the DXP image (using the major version defined in `LCP.json`) will deploy, that does not contain your customizations. This happens because you must specifically build and deploy any customizations with the service for them to be included.

Follow these steps to deploy the Liferay service with your customizations:

1. From the command-line in the `liferay/` directory, run:

   ```bash
   gw clean createDockerfile deploy
   ```

  This builds all of your customizations, and arranges them into a `build/liferay/` subfolder. It also adds a `Dockerfile` specifically for a customized version of DXP.

1. Copy the `LCP.json` file into the newly generated `build/docker/` subfolder.

1. Run the `lcp deploy` command as usual from this subfolder.

This deploys the customized service instead of a default version.

## Deploying Themes, Portlets, and OSGi Modules

To install themes, portlets, or OSGi modules, include a WAR or JAR file into a `configs/{ENV}/deploy/` folder in your Liferay DXP service directory.

For example, to deploy a custom JAR file to your development environment (using the `dev/` environment folder), your Liferay DXP service directory could look like this:

```
liferay
  ├── LCP.json
  └── configs
      └── dev
          ├── deploy
          │   └── com.liferay.apio.samples.portlet-1.0.0.jar
          ├── osgi
          ├── patching
          ├── scripts
          └── portal-ext.properties
```

Once deployed, any files within the `configs/{ENV}/deploy/` directory are copied to the `$LIFERAY_HOME/deploy/` folder in your Liferay service's container.

```{note}
If you are using version 3.x.x services in your repository, then themes, portlets, and OSGi modules instead belong in the appropriate `lcp/liferay/deploy/{ENV}` folder. See [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md) for more information on checking the version.
```

## Building and Deploying Source Code

The source code for new additions can also be included in a CI build. When the build starts, it will automatically compile the source code.

A CI build will compile source code within these folders:

* The `liferay/modules` folder for new modules
* The `liferay/themes` folder for custom themes
* The `liferay/wars` folder for exploded WARs

```{note}
If you are using version 3.x.x services, then these subfolders are located at the root of the repository instead of in the `liferay/` directory. See [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md) for more information on checking the version.
```

Once deployed, the deployable `.jar` or `.war` files are copied to the `$LIFERAY_HOME/deploy/` folder in your Liferay service's container. This occurs whether the build in CI compiles your code, or you generate it yourself using the available [Gradle command](#cli-tool-deployment) before deployment.

## Deploying Hotfixes

To apply hotfixes, add the hotfix ZIP file to a `configs/{ENV}/patching/` folder within the Liferay DXP service directory. When you deploy this change, the hotfix is applied to the Liferay DXP instance.

```{note}
See [these instructions](./updating-your-dxp-instance-to-a-new-minor-version.md) to update to a new minor version of Liferay DXP instead (such as a new [service pack](../../../../dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/maintaining-a-liferay-installation/patching-dxp-7-3-and-earlier/understanding-patch-types-for-dxp-7-3-and-earlier.md#service-packs)).
```

For example, you can deploy a hotfix to your development environment with a structure like the following:

```
liferay
  ├── LCP.json
  └── configs
      └── dev
          ├── deploy
          ├── osgi
          ├── patching
          │   └── liferay-hotfix-2-7110.zip
          └── scripts
```

Note that hotfixes will each need to be re-applied each time the server starts up. For this reason, updating to the latest Fix Pack or Service pack of the Liferay DXP Docker image in your `LCP.json` file is better than adding many hotfixes into this folder for the long term; you can update the Docker version by replacing the `image` environment variable in this file (in the `liferay/` directory.

```{note}
If you are using version 3.x.x services, then hotfixes are instead added into the `lcp/liferay/hotfix/` folder. The Docker image version in this case is instead defined with the `liferay.workspace.lcp.liferay.image` property, in your repository's `gradle.properties` file. See [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md) for more information on checking the version.
```

### Patching via Environment Variable

You can also install hotfixes as part of the CI build process instead of directly committing them to your Git repository. This approach is ideal for large hotfixes so you can avoid keeping large files in your repository.

Add a comma-delimited list of hotfixes to the `LCP_CI_LIFERAY_DXP_HOTFIXES_{ENV}` environment variable (either through the `Environment Variables` tab in the DXP Cloud console, or in the `ci` service's `LCP.json` file) for the CI service to automatically apply them during the build process.

```{note}
If you add this environment variable to the `LCP.json` for your `ci` service, then you must deploy the `ci` service to your **infra environment** to complete the update.
```

See the following example of defining hotfixes through in the `LCP.json` file:

```
"env": {
    "LCP_CI_LIFERAY_DXP_HOTFIXES_COMMON": "liferay-hotfix-10-7210,liferay-hotfix-17-7210",
    "LCP_CI_LIFERAY_DXP_HOTFIXES_DEV": "liferay-hotfix-15-7210,liferay-hotfix-33-7210",
}
```

```{note}
This environment variable is only available if you have upgraded to at least version 4.x.x services. See [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md) for more information on checking the version.
```

## Deploying Licenses

You can add your own license by putting it into a `configs/{ENV}/deploy/` folder within the Liferay DXP service directory.

For example, you can add licenses to your development environment with a structure like this in your Liferay DXP service directory:

```
liferay
  ├── LCP.json
  └── configs
      └── dev
          ├── deploy
          │   ├── license.xml
          │   └── license.aatf
          ├── osgi
          ├── patching
          └── scripts
```

Behind the scenes, XML licenses are copied to `$LIFERAY_HOME/deploy`, and AATF licenses are copied to `$LIFERAY_HOME/data`.

```{note}
If you are using version 3.x.x services, then licenses instead belong in the `lcp/liferay/license/{ENV}/` folder in your repository. See [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md) for more information on checking the version.
