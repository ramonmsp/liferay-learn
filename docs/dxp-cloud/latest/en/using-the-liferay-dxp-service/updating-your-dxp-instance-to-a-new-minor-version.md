# Updating Your DXP Instance to a New Minor Version

Regularly updating your Liferay DXP installation is an important part of maintaining your DXP Cloud environment. Use the available tags on the [Liferay DXP Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/dxp/tags) to update and deploy your service.

```{note}
Upgrading to a new major version (such as Liferay DXP 7.3) requires a different procedure from a smaller version update. See [Upgrading Your Liferay DXP Instance](./upgrading-your-liferay-dxp-instance.md) for more information.
```

```{note}
If you want to install a [hotfix](../../../../dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/maintaining-a-liferay-installation/patching-dxp-7-3-and-earlier/understanding-patch-types-for-dxp-7-3-and-earlier.md#hotfixes), then follow [these steps](./deploying-to-the-liferay-service.md#deploying-hotfixes) instead.
```

## Enabling Module Upgrades for DXP 7.3+

First, if you are updating a 7.3+ version of DXP, then set an environment variable to allow modules to upgrade as needed:

1. In the DXP Cloud console, click on the Liferay service in the desired environment.

1. Click the *Environment Variables* tab.

1. Add the `LIFERAY_UPGRADE_PERIOD_DATABASE_PERIOD_AUTO_PERIOD_RUN` variable to the list with a value of `true`.

1. Click the Save Changes button.

This allows your modules to perform the necessary upgrades for the new minor version of DXP. If you intend to allow modules to upgrade any time you are updating your version of DXP to a new fix pack or service pack, then you can keep this environment variable after the update.

## Updating and Deploying a New Version of DXP

Minor version updates to Liferay DXP also require a change to your project's repository.

```{important}
If you are using [clustered services](./setting-up-clustering-in-dxp-cloud.md) and updating to any version that changes the Liferay database schema (such as a [service pack](../../../../dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/maintaining-a-liferay-installation/patching-dxp-7-3-and-earlier/understanding-patch-types-for-dxp-7-3-and-earlier.html#service-packs)), then follow [these steps](#updating-to-a-new-service-pack-with-clustering-enabled).
```

Perform these steps to update and deploy changes in your project repository:

1. Find the tag for the version of Liferay you are updating to on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/dxp/tags).

1. In your repository, change the value of the `liferay.workspace.docker.image.liferay` property in [`liferay/gradle.properties`](./introduction-to-the-liferay-dxp-service.md#choosing-a-version) to the new version's tag:

    ```properties
    liferay.workspace.docker.image.liferay=liferay/dxp:7.3.10-ga1
    ```

1. Add this environment variable to the `env` block in your repository's `liferay/LCP.json` file:

    ```json
    {
        "LIFERAY_UPGRADE_PERIOD_DATABASE_PERIOD_AUTO_PERIOD_RUN": "true"
    }
    ```

1. [Deploy the change](./deploying-to-the-liferay-service.md) to the desired environment's `liferay` service.

1. For versions 7.3+ of DXP, if you do not intend to allow modules to upgrade when upgrading to new fix packs or service packs in the future, then remove the `LIFERAY_UPGRADE_PERIOD_DATABASE_PERIOD_AUTO_PERIOD_RUN` environment variable [you previously added](#enabling-module-upgrades-for-dxp) to the Liferay service's Environment Variables page.

Once you have deployed the changes, the `liferay` service restarts and begins any upgrade steps necessary to complete the update.

## Updating to a New Service Pack with Clustering Enabled

If you are updating to a version of Liferay DXP that changes the database schema, then your clustered `liferay` service requires temporary changes during the update procedure to ensure all nodes update correctly.

Follow these steps:

1. Set the `scale` property in your repository's `liferay/LCP.json` file to `1`:

   ```json
   {
       "scale": 1,
   }
   ```

1. [Deploy the change](../build-and-deploy/overview-of-the-dxp-cloud-deployment-workflow.md) to the `liferay` service.

1. Find the tag for the version of Liferay you are updating to on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/dxp/tags).

1. Change the value of the `liferay.workspace.docker.image.liferay` property in `liferay/gradle.properties` to the new version's tag:

    ```properties
    liferay.workspace.docker.image.liferay=liferay/dxp:7.3.10-ga1
    ```

1. Set the [deployment strategy](../build-and-deploy/understanding-deployment-strategies.md) to `Recreate` in `liferay/LCP.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "strategy": {
            "type": "Recreate"
        }
    }
    ```

1. [Deploy these changes](../build-and-deploy/overview-of-the-dxp-cloud-deployment-workflow.md) to the `liferay` service.

    The Liferay DXP installation on your `liferay` service updates to the new version as it starts up. However, you must still reverse the temporary changes made to your service.

1. Set the `scale` property back to the desired number of nodes in `liferay/LCP.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "scale": 3,
    }
    ```

1. Reset the deployment strategy in `liferay/LCP.json` to its former value (or remove the property if it was only added for the version update).

1. [Deploy the changes](../build-and-deploy/overview-of-the-dxp-cloud-deployment-workflow.md) one more time.

1. For versions 7.3+ of DXP, if you do not intend to allow modules to upgrade when upgrading to new fix packs or service packs in the future, then remove the `LIFERAY_UPGRADE_PERIOD_DATABASE_PERIOD_AUTO_PERIOD_RUN` environment variable [you previously added](#enabling-module-upgrades-for-dxp) to the Liferay service's Environment Variables page.

The updated `liferay` service starts back up with the desired number of nodes after the final deployment.
