# Configuring the Liferay DXP Service

There are several methods available to configure Liferay DXP: through the in [DXP System Settings](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/system-administration/configuring-liferay/system-settings.html) and through the use of [config](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/system-administration/configuring-liferay/configuration-files-and-factories/using-configuration-files.html) and [property files](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/reference/portal-properties.html).  DXP property and configuration files for your Liferay DXP instance in DXP Cloud are deployed by being placed inside of one of the `configs/` folders in the Liferay DXP service directory in your repository.

```
liferay
├── configs
│   ├── common
│   ├── dev
│   ├── local
│   ├── prd
│   └── uat
└── LCP.json
```

With the exception of the `common/` directory, changes added to an environment-specific folder (e.g., `dev`, `uat`, `prod`) will _only_ be propagated when deploying to the corresponding environment. Changes added to a `common/` directory will _always_ be deployed, regardless of the target deployment environment. This applies to all subfolders within the `configs/` directory, for all services.

```{note}
If you are using version 3.x.x services, then these configuration files instead belong in the appropriate `lcp/liferay/config/{ENV}/` folder. See [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md)_ for more information on checking the version.
```

## Portal Properties

[Portal properties](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/reference/portal-properties.html) are properties saved in a `portal-ext.properties` file. They are used to configure your Liferay DXP environment.

For an on-premises Liferay DXP instance, this file belongs inside of `$LIFERAY_HOME`. When using Liferay DXP Cloud, place portal properties file into the appropriate `configs/{ENV}/` folder(s) for them to be copied into `$LIFERAY_HOME` for the Liferay DXP instance on deployment.

For example, the properties in a dev environment will result from the property files in the `configs/common` directory and the properties in the `configs/dev` directory. If any files have the same name, the file in the environment specific directory will overwrite the file from the `common` directory.

```{note}
If you are using version 3.x.x services, then these configuration files instead belong in the appropriate `lcp/liferay/config/{ENV}/` folder. See [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md)_ for more information on checking the version.
```

### Splitting Portal Properties into Multiple Files

By default, Liferay will only read properties directly from the `portal-ext.properties` file, but it can be helpful to organize your properties into different files in your repository, such as environment-specific files. You can define additional files to override your portal properties:

* `portal-all.properties`: Contains the properties that change Liferay DXP across environments

* `portal-env.properties`: Contains the properties that only affect the current environment (for example, credentials and URL endpoints for external services that differ from environment to environment)

To use these files, the `portal-ext.properties` file must explicitly import `portal-all.properties` and `portal-env.properties` using the `include-and-override` property:

```
include-and-override=/opt/liferay/portal-all.properties
include-and-override=/opt/liferay/portal-env.properties
```

You can then organize your properties with the following structure:

```
liferay
├── configs
│   ├── common
│   │   ├── portal-ext.properties
│   │   └── portal-all.properties
│   ├── dev
│   │   └── portal-env.properties
│   ├── local
│   │   └── portal-env.properties
│   ├── prd
│   │   └── portal-env.properties
│   └── uat
│       └── portal-env.properties
└── LCP.json
```

The `portal-ext.properties` and `portal-all.properties` files are shared across all environments. You can add any shared properties there and add environment specific properties in each respective `portal-env.properties` file. For more information, see [Portal Property Priority](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/reference/portal-properties.html#portal-property-priority).

```{note}
Portal properties may also be defined as environment variables. See [the environment variables reference](./introduction-to-the-liferay-dxp-service.md#environment-variables-reference) for more information.
```

## OSGi Configurations

OSGi configurations (`.cfg` or `.config` files) are used to configure OSGi components in Liferay DXP.

These configuration files belong in the `osgi/configs/` folder inside of `$LIFERAY_HOME`. When using Liferay DXP Cloud, place these files into the appropriate `configs/{ENV}/osgi/` folder(s) for them to be copied into `/osgi/configs` for the Liferay DXP instance on deployment.

```{note}
If you are using version 3.x.x services, then OSGi configuration files instead belong in the appropriate `config/{ENV}/` folder within the Liferay service directory. See [Understanding Service Stack Versions](../reference/understanding-service-stack-versions.md)_ for more information on checking the version.
```

## Tomcat Configurations

Configure your Liferay service's Tomcat server by deploying files in the appropriate environment's `liferay/configs/{ENV}` folder to override the configuration files. For example, you can override the `{TOMCAT HOME}/conf/web.xml` file in your Liferay container's file system by placing the customized file in the appropriate `liferay/configs/{ENV}/tomcat/conf/` folder in your repository and deploying the changes.

```{note}
Two tomcat folders exist in the Liferay container in DXP Cloud: a generic `tomcat` folder, and a versioned folder (`tomcat-x.x.x`). The `tomcat` folder has a symbolic link to the versioned `tomcat-x.x.x` folder, so overriding a file in the generic `tomcat` folder ensures the new file reflects in both folders.
```

```{warning}
Keep in mind when overriding the default Tomcat configuration that the Liferay service in DXP Cloud exists in a closed network on the Cloud platform. Some network configurations that can be changed in an on-premises Liferay installation cannot be changed from the default values in a Cloud environment, or it may cause issues in your environment.
